  <p>
    On the 27 October 1981 at approximatly 20.00, a Soviet submarine ran aground on a skerry in Gåsefjärden, just 10km from one of Swedens largest naval bases, Karlskrona.
    The Russians sent a "rescue" party while the Swedish primeminister gave the order "Hold the border", instructing the military to shoot if any ships crossed the border.

    Luckily, after a few days the submarine was returned to Russia and the crisis was over, but this was Swedens "Cuban Missile Crisis".
